  author =	"Ji Lu and Jeramy C Ashlock",
  publisher =	"SelectedWorks",
  abstract =	"This report presents an experimental and computational
		 study on the recently-developed air-coupled impact-echo
		 (IE) nondestructive testing (NDT) method, in which
		 microphones replace the traditional physically-coupled
		 IE sensors. To develop an optimum testing system and
		 verify the new method, two concrete plates were tested
		 in the laboratory, one of which was a solid concrete
		 slab, and the other was a mock-up reinforced concrete
		 bridge deck with artificial defects. An IE testing
		 system was developed using a custom program written in
		 LabVIEW. The accuracy and feasibility of the
		 air-coupled test method to determine the solid
		 thickness of concrete structures and to detect defects
		 or flaws, such as delaminations or voids, were verified
		 by comparing test results obtained via the air-coupled
		 and physically-coupled sensors. When using the
		 air-coupled IE method in practice, ambient noise
		 generated by wind, traffic, and machinery will be
		 sensed by the microphones and therefore reduce the
		 signal to noise ratio of the data. Additionally, a
		 portion of the acoustic energy generated by the impacts
		 during testing will be lost due to the mismatch in
		 acoustic impedance between concrete and air. To address
		 these problems, a parabolic reflector and a sound
		 isolation enclosure were studied and found to improve
		 the quality of recorded signals compared to using a
		 microphone alone. Finite element method (FEM) based
		 numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL
		 Multi-physics software to understand the mechanics of
		 the air-coupled IE test, determine the optimum geometry
		 for the parabolic reflector, and investigate the
		 effects of the microphone height. Signal filtering
		 techniques including band-pass, high-pass, and adaptive
		 filters were implemented in MATLAB for post-processing
		 the test data. High-pass filters were found useful for
		 minimizing measured ambient traffic and wind noise,
		 which was determined to be primarily below 2 kHz.
		 Two-dimensional (2D) IE scanning tests were conducted
		 on the bridge deck with artificial defects to locate
		 the defect positions by the air-coupled and physically
		 coupled test methods. Results obtained by these two
		 methods are in good agreement, demonstrating the
		 accuracy and feasibility of the air-coupled IE test
		 method.",

  author =	"Ji Lu and Jeramy C Ashlock",
  publisher =	"SelectedWorks",
  abstract =	"This report presents an experimental and computational
		 study on the recently-developed air-coupled impact-echo
		 (IE) nondestructive testing (NDT) method, in which
		 microphones replace the traditional physically-coupled
		 IE sensors. To develop an optimum testing system and
		 verify the new method, two concrete plates were tested
		 in the laboratory, one of which was a solid concrete
		 slab, and the other was a mock-up reinforced concrete
		 bridge deck with artificial defects. An IE testing
		 system was developed using a custom program written in
		 LabVIEW. The accuracy and feasibility of the
		 air-coupled test method to determine the solid
		 thickness of concrete structures and to detect defects
		 or flaws, such as delaminations or voids, were verified
		 by comparing test results obtained via the air-coupled
		 and physically-coupled sensors. When using the
		 air-coupled IE method in practice, ambient noise
		 generated by wind, traffic, and machinery will be
		 sensed by the microphones and therefore reduce the
		 signal to noise ratio of the data. Additionally, a
		 portion of the acoustic energy generated by the impacts
		 during testing will be lost due to the mismatch in
		 acoustic impedance between concrete and air. To address
		 these problems, a parabolic reflector and a sound
		 isolation enclosure were studied and found to improve
		 the quality of recorded signals compared to using a
		 microphone alone. Finite element method (FEM) based
		 numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL
		 Multi-physics software to understand the mechanics of
		 the air-coupled IE test, determine the optimum geometry
		 for the parabolic reflector, and investigate the
		 effects of the microphone height. Signal filtering
		 techniques including band-pass, high-pass, and adaptive
		 filters were implemented in MATLAB for post-processing
		 the test data. High-pass filters were found useful for
		 minimizing measured ambient traffic and wind noise,
		 which was determined to be primarily below 2 kHz.
		 Two-dimensional (2D) IE scanning tests were conducted
		 on the bridge deck with artificial defects to locate
		 the defect positions by the air-coupled and physically
		 coupled test methods. Results obtained by these two
		 methods are in good agreement, demonstrating the
		 accuracy and feasibility of the air-coupled IE test
		 method.",
