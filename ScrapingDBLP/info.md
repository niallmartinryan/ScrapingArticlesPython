In Dblp they allow you to download an authors citations as bibtex,
So I plan to scrape firstly all the authors available on their site,
which shouldnt take too long as they store them quite compactly per page

Then running through each author, going to the appropriate page and downloading it as bibtex or scraping the page itself

May have just downloaded the entire library in xml format.. working on converting it to bibtex

Technical--

url for strings = dblp.uni-trier.de/pers?prefix=A
